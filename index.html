         Hi i'm Palash Shah! I'm currently working at Roboflow (YC20) as one of their first engineering hires. There, I'm building computer vision tools for tens of thousands of developers.

         <br />
         <br />

         Before, I built a collection of ML tools with <a href="https://www.paraglide.ai/">Paraglide</a>. Through this, I won the <a href="http://pioneer.app/"> Pioneer Tournament</a> and will be participating in their accelerator in the near future. 

         <br />
         <br />

         Over the past couple of months, I've built Turbine (a data-annotation platform to help managers understand their workforces), authored <a href="https://www.github.com/palashio/nylon/">Nylon</a> (an interactive grammar of machine learning), and built a full-scale web editor (with stripe integration, authentication, and interactive API components). 

  
         <br />
         <br />
         In the past, I've also authored <a href="https://libradocs.org/">Libra</a>: a machine learning API that lets you build and train models in just one-line of code. We currently have over 17,000 users, and is being used by universities around the globe in their introductory machine learning classes. I continue to contribute in my free time.</a>
         <br />
         <br />

         During the year, I spent some time doing research with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YVOmX-wAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Menon</a> from <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. We worked on performing medical disease analysis using 3D segmentation. Our work was <a href ="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11601/116010Z/Classification-of-lung-disease-using-CT-image-encodings-computed-from/10.1117/12.2582021.short?SSO=1">published.</a>
         <br />
         <br />

         Last summer, I worked at <a href="https://www.leidos.com/">Leidos</a> as a part of the GeoAxis group. I helped with the design of a new access-portal used by government customers. Before that, I led a team of researchers at <a href="https://www.fbk.eu/en/">Fondazione Bruno Kesseler</a> in Trentino Italy to help with brain tumor identification and segmentation.

         <br />
         <br />

         I'm excited about <a href = "https://palashs.substack.com/">writing</a>, startups, and the future of reinforcement learning.

         <br />
         <br />

         At UVA, I've served as a Teaching Assistant for UVA's <a href="https://www.coursicle.com/virginia/courses/CS/2102/">CS 2102</a> (Discrete Mathematics) and now for <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQVuhZNpkmBA1WlnH-QlUjY7BMe45MoUWYWZvNdRYVxCi8ncDqQSHhx6pQqdIoF3gmK7Z-_uh4UpF-j/pub0">CS 4774</a> (Machine Learning).
