         Hi i'm Palash Shah! I'm currently taking a break from school to build <a href="https://www.paraglide.ai/">Paraglide </a>. I recently won the <a href="http://pioneer.app/"> Pioneer Tournament</a> and will be participating in their accelerator soon.
         <br />
         <br />
         I recently authored <a href="https://libradocs.org/">Libra</a>: a machine learning API that lets you build and train models in just one-line of code. We currently have over 10,000 users, and is being used by universities around the globe in their introductory machine learning classes.</a>
         <br />
         <br />

         On the side, I'm doing research with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YVOmX-wAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Menon</a> from <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. We're working on medical disease analysis using image encodings, and plan to release a library called maple in the near future.

         <br />
         <br />

         This summer, I worked at <a href="https://www.leidos.com/">Leidos</a> as a part of the GeoAxis group. I helped with the design of a new access-portal used by government customers. Before that, I led a team of researchers at <a href="https://www.fbk.eu/en/">Fondazione Bruno Kesseler</a> in Trentino Italy to help with brain tumor identification and segmentation.

         <br />
         <br />

         I'm excited about reinforcement learning as well as scalable distributed systems. Please reach out to me if you're interested in chatting about <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/07/duality-new-approach-to-reinforcement.html">Google's Duality</a> framework or <a href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/first/ebook/node66.html#:~:text=The%20policy%20structure%20is%20known,being%20followed%20by%20the%20actor.">Actor Critics.</a>

         <br />
         <br />

         I'm also interested in computer science education. I've served as a Teaching Assistant for UVA's <a href="https://www.coursicle.com/virginia/courses/CS/2102/">CS 2102</a> (Discrete Mathematics) and now for <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQVuhZNpkmBA1WlnH-QlUjY7BMe45MoUWYWZvNdRYVxCi8ncDqQSHhx6pQqdIoF3gmK7Z-_uh4UpF-j/pub0">CS 4774</a> (Machine Learning).
