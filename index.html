         Hi i'm Palash Shah! I'm currently living in New York, building industrial IoT at <a href="https://www.samsara.com/">Samsara</a>. 
      
         <br />
         <br />

         Last year, I worked at Zapier part-time, and worked in their special projects department. I built the foundation for their natural language interface, where users are allowed to
         build Zaps from english language statements. You can find the release of this in <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/ai-open-letter/">their blog</a>. 

         <br />
         <br />
         Previously, I worked Ideaflow, where I built software to make sense of the world. Before, I was at Roboflow (YC20) as one of their first engineering hires. There, I built computer vision tools for tens of thousands of developers.

         <br />
         <br />

         Before that, I attempted to start my own company. I built a collection of machine learning tools with <a href="https://pioneer.app/winners/palash-shah">Paraglide</a>. Through this, I won the <a href="https://ioneer.app/winners/palash-shah">Pioneer tournament</a>. 
         My time at Paraglide was spent, building Turbine (a data-annotation platform to help managers understand their workforces), authoring <a href="https://www.github.com/palashio/nylon/">Nylon</a> (an interactive grammar of machine learning), and building a full-scale web editor (with stripe integration, authentication, and interactive API components). 

         <br />
         <br />
         My personal favorite work of mine is <a href="https://libradocs.org/">Libra</a>: a machine learning API that lets you build and train models in just one-line of code. At its peak, it had over 35,000 users, and was being used by universities around the globe in their introductory machine learning classes. I continue to contribute in my free time.</a>
         <br />
         <br />

         I also dabble in the research space. A couple years ago, I worked with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YVOmX-wAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Menon</a> from Carnegie Mellon. We worked on performing medical disease analysis using 3D segmentation. Our work was <a href ="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11601/116010Z/Classification-of-lung-disease-using-CT-image-encodings-computed-from/10.1117/12.2582021.short?SSO=1">published.</a>
         <br />
         <br />

         In high-school, I led a team of researchers at <a href="https://www.fbk.eu/en/">Fondazione Bruno Kesseler</a> in Trentino Italy to help with brain tumor identification and segmentation.

         <br />
         <br />

         I love trying new restaurants, coffee, and working out. Let me know if you're in New York and want to chat.
